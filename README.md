I have set up Parcel for my application so that it can generate the elements needed for my file to be viewed on a browser.
To re run the process of generating these files you need to naveigate to the myFlix-client folder and command parcel src/index.html 
Running this should overwrite all files in the dist folder to the active files that can be viewed on browser.
