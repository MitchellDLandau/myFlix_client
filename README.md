I have set up Parcel for my application so that it can generate the elements needed for my file to be viewed on a browser.
To re run the process of generating these files you need to naveigate to the myFlix-client folder and command parcel src/index.html 

My role in the development was that of the full stack web developer. I created the app using react react-bootstrap to help with the styling. 

While creating the app I wanted to add more functionality than was required. To do this I used the added functions for a moderator that I created in my API to allow them to have acces to more functions. If a user is labeled as a moderator they can now add a movie to the DB instead of having an administrator add it manually to the DB. 
I also wanted to be able to have the user click on a hero displayed in the movie view so that they can see a list of all movies they are in. 

If I were to do something differently I would have wanted to have the signup view automatically log the user in when they signup. I insted have the page direct the user to the login page instead which still functions well. I would also want to spend some more time to allow the Mods to be able to use more features than they currently can.
